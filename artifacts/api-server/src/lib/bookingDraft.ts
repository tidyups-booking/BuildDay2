 * so the form only has one way to fill itself in.

 * uncertain we return nothing rather than a guess — an empty box is a prompt to
 * ask the customer, whereas a wrong address gets saved and sent to a crew.
 *
 * Deliberately plain pattern matching, not an AI call: the dispatcher presses
 * this button mid-sentence, so it has to answer instantly and give the same

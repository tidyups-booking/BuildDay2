/**
 * One Clerk account can hold exactly one seat (clerk_user_id is unique
 * table-wide) and owning a company always wins during caller resolution. So
 * an invite sent to an address whose person is already attached to a company
 * — as an owner or via a claimed seat anywhere — can NEVER be accepted: it
 * just sits as "Waiting to join" forever.
 *
 * These helpers detect that situation so the invite can be blocked up front
 * and existing stranded invites can be labelled honestly.

/**
 * Of the given addresses, which are already attached to a company and can
 * therefore never claim a new seat?
 *
 * Two signals, both checked:
 *  1. Database — a claimed seat (clerk_user_id set) with the same address.
 *  2. Clerk — an existing account under that address whose user id owns a
 *     company or holds a claimed seat (covers owners, whose email is not in
 *     team_members, and people whose seat email differs from their login).
 *
 * The Clerk check is best-effort: an outage there must not take the Team
 * page down, so failures degrade to "not blocked" rather than throwing.

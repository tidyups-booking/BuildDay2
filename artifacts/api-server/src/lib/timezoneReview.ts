 * After a company timezone change, flag upcoming bookings whose *displayed*
 * wall-clock time is different in the new zone than it was in the old one.
 *
 * Bookings are stored as UTC instants, so the instant is unchanged — but a
 * booking entered while the company sat on the wrong zone was entered as a
 * wall-clock agreement with the customer. Any booking whose rendered hour just
 * shifted may now disagree with that agreement, so the owner must confirm or
 * adjust each one.
 *
 * Only pending/confirmed bookings in the future are flagged: past and
 * completed/canceled jobs can't be missed anymore. A booking already awaiting
 * review keeps its original "previous" zone so the review UI still shows the
 * time the owner actually saw when it was entered.

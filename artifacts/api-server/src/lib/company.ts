 * the row on every call.
 *
 * The write is conditional on the row still holding the opposite value, so a
 * healthy → needs-reauth transition is claimed exactly once even when the
 * hourly health check and a webhook race. The same write records that a
 * notification is owed (quoNotifyPending: "dead" or "restored"), and the
 * winning caller immediately attempts to deliver it.
 *
 * The flag itself never reverts because of a notification problem: the
 * dashboard warning flips on the first detection of a dead key and stays put.
 * If the text can't be sent right now, the pending marker survives and the
 * hourly health check (via sendPendingQuoNotification) keeps retrying until
 * it goes out — so the one-per-outage guarantee holds without ever lying
 * about connection health.

/**
 * A seat held by a Clerk account that no longer exists.
 *
 * This happens two ways: the account was deleted, or the database was copied
 * between Clerk instances (a development dump restored into production) so
 * every stored user id was never valid there in the first place. Either way
 * the seat still reads as "claimed", the invite match skips it, and the real
 * person is dropped into onboarding on every sign-in — where the only thing
 * on offer is creating a second, empty company beside the one they belong to.
 *
 * These tests pin the release and, just as importantly, the three cases that
 * must NOT release a seat: a live holder, an unverified email, and Clerk
 * being unreachable.
